# Trippy-Travel-Tracker 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

 I built ,styled and provided functionality using HTML, Javascript and CSS togethor to create a website application. Within this website, the user has the option to Login. Once the user  has logged in,  the user has the capability to view all past, upcomming, and pending flights. Users can also input their travel details such as the destination, travel dates, duration of trip, number of travelers, and any other relevant information. This information is used to generate a list of pending flights that meet the user's criteria. Once the user selects a flight with all inputs, they can proceed to see a payment table where they can view there pending flights and overall costs of everything.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

 I would first provide them with the link to the main repository in which all working branches have been merged. Ask them to access the SSH code and 'git clone' down to their local terminal. From there they would open this directory in VS code / Atom. To access the site they would type  'open index.html' in their termianl to retrieve the HTML site itself. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)



### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was given to us on 04/18/23 and had to be completed by 04/25/23.We were on our 3rd week of the Mod2 course- it took 6 days and a total of 23-26 hours on this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals was to be able to build an HTML layout that was functionable, stylized with CSS and functionality using Javascript. In doing so I was able to apply my knowledge and further the understanding of 'Flex' within CSS styles which helped me with the website layout and organzation of travel-tracker. Then I would apply insight into what the site was able to do and what features I would half to write functionality for in order for it to operate as a "Travel-Tracker".In order to manipulate the DOM from my Javascript , I had to maintain the order of 'parent-child' elements in my HTML and pinpoint them through Javascript and CSS. JavaScript would is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). This allowed me to dynamically update the content of the website in response to user actions. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Successfully building a functional and stylized travel-tracker website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a relatively short time frame.I feel I gainined a deeper understanding of CSS's "Flex" property and how it can be used to create flexible and responsive website layouts.Developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills identified for the necessary features and functionality for the website which worked to implement them using JavaScript.Managing time effectively to complete the project within the given deadline of one week while still maintaining a level of quality in the code was challenging.Debugging and troubleshooting issues with the code, such as pinpointing errors in the HTML and JavaScript that were causing problems with the functionality of the website seemed to be a plateau within this project.Balancing the need for functionality with the need for aesthetic design is always a factor, ensuring that the website not only worked well but also looked visually appealing to users (and myself.)
